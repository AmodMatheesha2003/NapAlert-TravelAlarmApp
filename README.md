# Nap Alert - Travel Alarm App 

Nap Alert is a simple Android application that helps travelers rest without worrying about missing their destination.  
Users can set a location, and the app will play an alarm when they are within 500 meters of it.

## Features
- Set a destination using Google Maps and Places Autocomplete.
- Alarm triggers automatically when near the destination.
- Built with Kotlin and XML.
- Uses Google Maps API for location tracking.

## Setup Instructions
Before running the app, replace the Google Maps API key inside the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" />
```

Make sure your API key has Maps SDK for Android and Places API enabled.
